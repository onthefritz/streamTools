# Stream Tools that can integrate into OBS

I have a couple of applications in here that help with some tasks that I do on stream. They are free to use and if you know how to code you are free to contribute or fork and make your own changes. I will approve any PRs into the repo but you're always welcome to either put one in or just log a bug. 

## Pointathon

I created this for an Affiliate anniversary stream. I've seen people setup inventives based on any type of contribution so I made a tool that integrates with Lioranboard to help count points for me. 

There are two types for this, you can either use a Windows specific one with an exe file or you can use a Python variant. For Windows users, if you want to use the Python one you will need to install Python 3.9. It's in the Windows Store so it's easy to get.
